# JSON-gen-for-Firebase

I am developing an Android app ["Warsaw For Kids"](https://github.com/marekbodziony/WarsawForKids) as a part of [WAWCODE](http://wawcode.pl) hackathon. Mobile app is connected with Firebase realtime databse (Firebase uses JSON format to store data). I needed a tool to generates JSON file with data for my app.  

JSON-gen adds elements with specified values (name, date of event, description, www, gps, ratings, likes) to JSON file, then saves the file in 'firebase.json', which can be uploaded in Firebase. 

You can download [json-gen.jar](https://github.com/marekbodziony/JSON-gen-for-Firebase/raw/master/json-gen.jar).

Application was developed as JavaFX app in Eclipse with external library [json-simple ver.1.1.1](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/), the view was developed with SceneBuilder.
