# JSON-gen-for-Firebase

I am developing an Android app "Warsaw For Kids" which is connected with Firebase realtime databse (Firebase uses JSON format to store data). I needed a tool to generates JSON file with data for my app.  

JSON-gen adds elements with specified values (name, date of event, description, www, gps, ratings, likes) to JSON file, then saves the file in 'firebase.json', which can be uploaded in Firebase. 

Here you can find [json-gen.jar](https://github.com/marekbodziony/JSON-gen-for-Firebase/blob/master/json-gen.jar).
