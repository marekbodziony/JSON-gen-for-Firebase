# JSON-gen-for-Firebase

I am developing an Android app "Warsaw For Kids" which is connected with Firebase realtime databse (Firebase uses JSON format to store data). I needed a tool to generates JSON file with data for my app.  

JSON-gen adds elements with specified values (name, date of event, description, www, gps, ratings, likes) to JSON file, then saves the file in 'firebase.json', which can be uploaded in Firebase.
